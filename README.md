# nepi_link_ros_bridge #
This repository hosts code and support files for the nepi_link_ros_bridge node, which connects the nepi-bot on-device cloud interface with the rest of the NEPI ROS on-device infrastructure (by way of the _nepi_edge_sdk_link_ interface library). This allows ROS topics and services to become data sources for the cloud and to configure events and rates at which that cloud interface is enabled and executed.

### Build and Install ###
This repository is typically built as part of the _nepi_base_ws_ catkin workspace. Refer to that project's top-level README for build and install instructions.

The repository may be included in other custom catkin workspaces or built using standard CMake commands (with appropriate variable definitions provided), though it should be noted that the executables here work in concert with a complete NEPI Engine installation, so operability and functionality may be limited when building outside of the _nepi_base_ws_ source tree.

### Branching and Tagging Strategy ###
In general branching, merging, tagging are all limited to the _nepi_base_ws_ container repository, with the present submodule repository kept as simple and linear as possible.

### Contribution guidelines ###
Bug reports, feature requests, and source code contributions (in the form of pull requests) are gladly accepted!

### Who do I talk to? ###
At present, all user contributions and requests are vetted by Numurus technical staff, so you can use any convenient mechanism to contact us.
